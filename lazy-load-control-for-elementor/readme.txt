Remove the Lazy Load attribute from specific images in Elementor.

== Description ==

It adds a control to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/">Elementor</a> image widget to remove the Lazy Load attribute.
Normally, if you use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/">Elementor</a>, also the first image that appears in the viewport is lazy loaded, and this is not good for performance.
By removing the lazy load attribute to the first image that appears in the viewport you can improve the LCP which is an important performance metric.

== How to remove the lazy load attribute from specific images with Elementor ==
* Install and activate Lazy Load Control For Elementor
* Select "Do not lazy load" in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/">Elementor</a> image widget.
* Save.
* Done!

Watch the following video to see how it works.

== Premium Version ==

With the premium version you can also load the background images of specific sections lazily. It means they will be loaded only when the section enters the viewport.
This will drastically improve the page loading performance. Install <a href="https://shop.josemortellaro.com/downloads/lazy-load-control-for-elementor/">Lazy Load Control For Elementor PRO</a> for further speed up your Elementor website.
